# Adaptive Energy Alignment (AEA) for Test-Time Adaptation

Official repository of our work on **Adaptive Energy Alignment (AEA)** for **Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)**. Our paper will be published in **ICLR 2025**. This repository includes a quick summary of our method and a code implementation.

> TL;DR: We propose an adaptive energy alignment (AEA) that accelerates the model adaptation in online TTA scenarios. Specifically, our AEA strategically reduces the energy gap between the source and target domains during TTA, aiming to align the target domain with the source domains and thus to accelerate adaptation.
